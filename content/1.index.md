I’m Roslan Saidi, a software engineer from Malaysia.

As a Software Engineer with expertise in Laravel (PHP) and Phoenix (Elixir) frameworks for API development and Nuxt (Vue + Javascript) for frontend development. My speciality lies in building performant and scalable applications which I have successfully delivered for various projects throughout my career - ranging from small startups to large enterprises.

Apart from my technical skills, I possess extensive experience with AWS services including EC2, S3, Lambda and have proficiently deployed and managed complex systems on the cloud. Currently, I'm expanding my skillset by learning Go and I'm thrilled to apply this newfound knowledge to build more robust and efficient software.

I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and techniques to keep up with the latest trends in software engineering. My passion lies in creating high-quality and maintainable code that provides real value to the end-users.
